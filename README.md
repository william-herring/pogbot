# pogbot

Pogbot is an open-source multi-purpose Discord bot written in discord.py.
As of 25/10/21, I no longer maintain pogbot. Feel free to clone and host yourself.

# hosting

To host pogbot for yourself, clone this repository and create a file called 
tokens.py. Create a discord application and copy the token corresponding with
the following code:

```py
token = 'enter token here'
def get_token():
    return token
```
